# Onegin
Почему программа называется Онегин? **Хороший вопрос**

Она сортирует строки, изначально была сделана для сортировки текста произвенения А.С.Пушкина "Евгений Онегин", но как оказалось, с русским все не так просто, поэтому пришлось забыть об оригинальном тексте, НО никто не запрещал сортировать английскую версию текста.

На вход программе подается текстовый файл с названием "text.txt", в котором должен находиться текст на АНГЛИЙСКОМ языке. Этот файл должен находиться в папке с проектом. Для создания этой папки вам придется установить Code::Blocks, или другую среду разработки, но за работоспособность в других средах я ответственность не несу (хотя, вышеупомянутый код блокс тоже не вызывает доверия).
Программа создаст текстовый файл "output.txt", в который запишет:
1) Строки текста, отсортированные по возрастанию.
2) Строки текста, отсортированные по возрастанию, НО с конца (рядом будут стоять строки с одинаковым окончанием).
3) Исходный текст.

And by opposing end them. To dieтАФto sleep,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
And lose the name of action.
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
And thus the native hue of resolution
But that the dread of something after death,
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
Must give us pauseтАФthere's the respect
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
Than fly to others that we know not of?
That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
That makes calamity of so long life.
That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
The insolence of office, and the spurns
The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn
Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all,
To be, or not to be, that is the question:
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
To sleep, perchance to dreamтАФay, there's the rub:
When he himself might his quietus make
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
With this regard their currents turn awry
