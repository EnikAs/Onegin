     Friend of my heart, be at my side,
     Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila,
     Friends, all this meant was: I've a date
     Friends, how my heart would leap with pleasure
     friends, recollect how I surrendered
     Friendship, as I must own to you,
     From all sweet things that gave me pleasure,
     from Boston's cloth or gossip's quote;
     from drowning's death in Lethe river
     From early on she loved romances,
     from German realms of mist and steam,
     from her Monsieur took on the child.
     From here, deep-sunk in pensive woe,
     From his first youth he'd known the force,
     From hour to hour a surer capture
     from Million Street16 came floating round;
     From that rough spell at last exempted,
     from their own country? Then she shot
     From violent passions fast pulsating
     From widow Clicquot and from Moët,
     from young Tatyana's dwelling-place,
     frost gleams. We watch with gleeful thanks
     fruit liqueurs and an Almanack
     Full of obedience and demureness,
     galop, mazurka, waltz... Meanwhile

     He asks. She can't accept. Why ever?
     He could have spoken without harming,
     He cursed Theocritus and Homer,
     He deemed, in general, letters vain,
     He destined Olga's hand for me,
     he doesn't hear when I address
     He drained his glass down to the end
     He finds the shock beyond all bearing:
     He followed them without illusion,
     he found Tatyana so attractive,
     He found them in some old collection,
     He gave his arm. In sad abstraction,
     He gave this figure -- loved with passion,
     He gave three balls a year, and rather
     He goes inside, corpse-like of feature...
     He got so used to this immersion,
     He lacked the slightest predilection
     He lay quite still, and strange as dreaming
     He looks, and answers: ``Agafon.''4
     He mounts the sledge, with daylight fading:
     he murmurs: ``Olga's mine for saving;
     He nods -- they start to fuss and truckle;
     He opens up a door. What's that
     he read of course the sceptic Bayle15
     He reads to Olga on occasion,
     He rings at once, and what a scurry!
     He roamed the world, his lyre behind him;
     He sang of grief and parting-time,
     He sang of love, to love subjected,
     He saw the sad girl's trembling state,
     He sees: in slush, stretched out and keeping
     He smiled as Lensky talked: the heady
     He sweetened up with fancy's icing
     He thought that Olga'd be confused,
     he turns away: ``I've had enough --
     He wakes -- and who is this who writes him?
     He was a good and simple barin;6
     He was convinced, a kindred creature
     He was no fool; appreciated
     He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
     He was the slave of a tenacious,
     He was too young to have been blighted
     He was without that dithyrambic
     He who has lived and thought is certain
     He'd brought back all the fruits of learning
     He'd given up girls -- now gave up letters,
     he'd sack the Muses and get wedded;
     he'd swim this Hellespont; then later
     He's always with her: either seated
     He's flown to Talon's,4 calculating
     he's gnawed by serpent Recollection,
     He's gone away and left his village,
     he's got consumption. In his anguish
     He's here -- Monsieur Guillot, my friend.
     he's host, that's obvious. Thus enlightened
     He's neither died, nor lost his reason,
     He's off -- this ruthless legislator
     he's put belle Tatiana instead.

     I ask you, each and every poet!
     I buttonhole a wandering neighbour
     I can see naught, as Hymen's foe,

     I don't know why, but for my friend
     I don't mean that she never shivered,
     ``I don't see what's so bad about it.''
     I drag my footsteps hither, yonder;
     ``I dread your stern regard surmising
     I drop my hero... I'll be truthful:
     I feel a brotherly affection,
     I feel a small foot in my hand;
     I find myself no longer equal;
     I find no sense; the truth is this,
     I gave my word, alas, though now
     I gave no rein to sweet affection:
     I grasp a stirrup with affection,
     I had most surely never reckoned
     I have no leisure to recall;
     I have to drag my feet to it.
     I hear the wrath of your reproach.
     I hear you say. But can you see
     I introduced my saucy Muse
     I keep them, and will quote them here:
     I kept in mind an ancient store

     I know your heart: it has a feeling
     I know, Godsent one, I'm protected
     I lack the strength required to say
     I leave the verdict in your hand.

     I like to tell the time by dinner

     I love you (what's the use to hide
     I make magnanimous confession,
     I married. I beseech you, go;

     I might have seen you, heard you speak
     I move in the grand monde? that rank,
     I must translate -- there's no presuming --
     I must wake up with the conviction
     I need to rest from all this rhyme:
     I never lived or wrote for praise;
     ``I noticed once, at our chance meeting,
     I only write like this, you know,
     I own it: tender Parny's12 rhyme
     I pray God grant his soul salvation,

     I put your genius to the test,

     I still find Gallicism delicious
     I suffered once from all the madness
     I thank him without reservation,

     I weep, and pray for your protection..,
     ``I weep... In case there still should linger
     I would have chosen none but you
     I would have found a friend, another,
     I would have had the indiscretion

     I'd still like dances to this day:
     I'll catalogue each simple saying
     I'll conjure up that swooning fashion
     I'll end my tale some other time.
     I'll feed the journalists for dinner
     I'll float in gondola's seclusion;
     I'll gladden your imagination,
     I'll go, I'll go!'' -- and in a stir
     I'll just remark, my verses talk
     I'll make them spar another round,
     I'll part them, bring them back together;
     I'll save this blossom on the shoot,
     I'll say: with past ideals in view
     I'll set two ages by the ears.
     I'll sprinkle you with holy water,
     I'll stop that tempter from depraving
     I'm altering my destination
     I'm at your service to protect you;
     I'm blind to every apparition;
     I'm good for nothing now, my sweet...
     I'm grateful now with all my heart.
     I'm grieving still, but no more tears,
     I'm much afraid that bilberry wine
     I'm near to sobbing, near to weeping!...''
     I'm old, my mind is blunted, Tanya;
     I'm sick, my dear, I'm sick indeed.
     I'm terrified -- so let it be...
     I'm wandering in a world of dreams...
     I'm yours, in a predestined fashion,
     I've drawn a plan and a projection,

     Now hear the friends in dialogue:
     Now here's a letter, as you see,
     now I've forgotten all I knew.
     Now Latin's gone quite out of favour;

        Tatyana's Letter to Onegin
     Tatyana's letter, treasured ever
     Tatyana's love is no by-play,
     Tatyana's name day celebration.
     Tatyana's rites are not for me.
     Tatyana, hiding her condition,
     Tatyana, hunted by love's anguish,
     Tatyana, lonely heroine,
     Tatyana, sleepless in the dark,
     Tatyana3 was her name... I own it,
     ``Tell me, our neighbours, are they thriving?
     ``Tell me, what's your companion doing?''
     than most. Evgeny, though he knew
     thank God, he had no inclination
     Thank you for all the gifts I treasure,
     thank you indeed. Alike in sorrow
     that alien scene must I now turn
     that all of Russia can't contribute
     that could sustain it? Only grimness;
     that I prefer to Champagne's tide;
     that I'm just longing to indite --
     that in the usual Christmas scrimmage
     That isn't our immediate worry:
     that Lensky and Eugene, apart,
     that marble Nina's proved unable
     that Menelaus was quite right --
     that once I spent my happiest days?
     That point I wouldn't mind contesting,
     that stretched from Romulus in his prime
     that there his friend Kavérin's5 waiting;
     That year the season was belated
     that youthful heart. ``But now at least
     that's the morass, I beg you note,
     That's when I'll sit down to compose
     that, like proud Byron, I can draw
     18 ``The  author, on  his mother's  side,  is of  African  descent...''
     The arbitrary rules of passion
     The aunts exchanged a look, they fluttered,
     The banquet's given no cause for sneezing,
     The bearded outrider is sitting
     The better to dispel her sorrow
     The bitterness was mine -- the ice
     The book displayed, not so you'd know it,
     The censor's tribute, I'll arrange:
     The château was of a construction
     The choirs of dancers sought their quarters.
     The city's early sounds awake her;
     The clock of doom had struck as fated;
     The comrade of so many days,
     the Corsair, or the Wandering Jew.
     The crush, the heat, as music blares,
     The darkness thins away; but still
     The days flew past; by now the season
     the earlier griefs are what I miss.
     ``The elegy's just vain protesting,
     The evening passes, and meanwhile
     the fear and rage with which I foam!
     The fields are dark, since evening came.
     The fire was dying; cinders faintly
     The flirt has reason's cool volition;
     the floor serves Triquet for his nap,
     the glare, the fumes in which I live,
     The hall is full of noise and hustle,
     the hapless Phrygians all the same,
     The happiness of youth is dead,
     The hearth was low beyond all stoking.
     The horses, as they sense the dead,
     the hour was late. And now from aching
     The house is packed out; scintillating,
the Neva.''
     ``The house, the park... I'll go and see!''
     The illness with which he'd been smitten
     The invalid's glad salutation,
     The jealous poet's gloom is lightened!
     The kinsfolk in concerted action
     The lady of the house has fled.
     The Larins kept the old tradition:
     the letter from Tatyana's hand:
     ``The Lord God be with you, my daughter!''
     the Lord have mercy on us all!
     the lover of Julie Wolmar,3
     the Major's here: he's all the rage
     ``The man's a boor; his brain is missing,
     The manor house, in deep seclusion,
     the modish Record Office clerks
     ``The morning star will soon be shining,
     the murmuring Nereids recite,
     the Muses' lofty arts and fashions,
     The nervous-tragical reaction,
     The night has many stars that glitter,
     The north wind blows, the clouds are driving --
     The old dame had no thought of scouring
     The olden days, I want to hear...''
     ``The one you love's the younger daughter?''
     the party waits. Seized with an illness
     the peaceful Muses' devotee,
     ``The peasants there have wealth abounding,
     the pensive Dryads' hiding-ground.
     The place where Eugene loathed his leisure
     The ploughman there delights to doze,
     The poet's dead... already though
     the poet's only theme is ``I.''
     The princess, sitting peaked and wan,
     The protocol is all one wishes:
     the Russian for le comme il faut.
     the Russian N, like N in French;
     The rustic sage, in that apartment,
     the shepherd sings of Volga's fishing
     The sky breathed autumn, time was flowing,
     The sky is clear, the earth is frozen;
        The Song of the Girls
     The storm is over,5 dawn is paling,
     the strain of Tasso's octave-rhyme!
     the strophe over which I slaved;
     the tolerant Evgeny heard --
     The tomcat, mannered and affected,
     the tongue of love and of Petrarch.
     the towers of whitestone Moscow beaming
     The two old ladies kiss and cry;
     the valley's dark. The forest lands
     The vote was passed without demur.
     5 The week before Lent.
     The World found this enough to treat
     The world of fashion, prone to flatter,
     The yard was bursting with dependants;
     The years incline to gloom and prosing,
     The years would pass; no longer youthful,
     their cloaks; Zaretsky's measured off
     Their look, though, shows no change upon it --
     Their talk, so sound on every matter,
     Then doors are opened, Lensky enters,
     then from the Muse there came revival:
     Then gradually upon sensation,
     then I'd have looked for you alone
     Then in return for all this twaddle,
     then Lensky moved his pawn, and took,
     Then our Automedons are flashing,
     ``Then send your grandson with this letter
     then sudden fear attacked Tatyana...
     Then Tanya hears of the decision.
     Then verdicts from her husband's quartet
     Then what resulted from the meeting?
     Then with a half-ethereal splendour,
     Then, after midday he'll be waking;
     Then, crying, they untwined my plait,
     then, help me God, she caterwauls:
     ``Then, in the backwoods, far from rumour
     Then, plunged in the housekeeper's day,
     then, stepping nearer, Eugene said:
     There came a murmur, for a fleeting
     there caustic Shakhovskóy8 came in
     there Didelot10 crowned himself with glory:
     There many pages keep the impression
     There once I too strolled back and forth:
     There sings the nightingale, spring's lover,
     There too, he honoured, hotly weeping,
     There was -- --,10 so notorious
     There was a period when cold-blooded
     There was a pine-branch downward straying
     There you're entirely sure of finding
     there'll be a fight. For that I give
     There's din of parting now that rages,
     There's powdery snow up to her knees;
     There's vacancies in plenty there.''
     ``There, just in front of all that swarm,
     There, with epigrammatic neatness,
     These days I'm finding even gladness,
     These figures from the world of seeming,
     6 These lines and the first twelve lines of stanza XLVII were discarded
     these words are not of Russian stock:
     they buried Uncle, congregated
     They buzz -- but then all talk's suspended --
     They laugh. The guests begin arriving.
     they nudged Tatyana, and each muttered
     they praise the Father of the world.
     They should be forced to read in Russian,
     They sing; unmoved by their sweet-sounding
     They take her too to the Assembly.
     They will receive us with delight.''
     They're settled in; and crawling, sliding,
     They've missed Eugene's completed etching.
     This dear, still world I must forswear
     this Grandison of hers was splendid,
     ``this is the one!'' Ah, ever stronger,
     ``This is Vladimir Lensky's grave
     4  This Russianized version of  the Greek Agatho  is  ``elephantine and
     ``This time I think you've been reduced to
     this very day I'd gladly give,
     This wearisome perambulation
     This work of the profoundest learning
     This world's so vacuous that it's got
     Those friends, those friends! it is, I fear,
          thou, my Svetlana!
     Though belles had lost his adoration,
     though cold I am and sad; in sleep
     though I'll come back to him, yet clearly
     Though long since Eugene's disapproval
     though Menelaus, in Helen's name,
     though what's romantic here I simply
     though years ago I used to look
     Three whole hours, at the least accounting,
     threw Eugene at her feet -- she stirred,
     Thronged by adorers, I've detected
     through him is sweetness' self. In grumbling
     Through the tight ranks -- aristocratic,
     Throughout their life, so calm, so peaceful,
     till Moscow, meekly on its knees,
     till now our language -- proud, God knows --
     Time races, and she's been forgetting
     Time was, he'd been the wittiest ever,
     times were when I was sharp and bold:
     to Aÿ's vintage in the sequel
     to a soirée. ``My God! to her!...
     To batten down their indignation
     To be a butt for the malicious
     to be the bride I'd call my own.
     to bring across Lepage's4 mortal
     to Eugene all was new and thrilling;
     to Eugene's letter, word for word.
     to Eugene; nineteen to the dozen,
     to Evgeny. Oh, God, she'd never...
     to expose to Moscow fops and Circes
     to face him now I feel too frail...
     To face society's derision
     To harmless idleness devoted,
     to hear him howl: ``that's me!'' You'll get
     to heart. And in his misted gaze
     to his Tatyana, yes, he's racing,
     to kiss Armida's lips, or seek
     to lift his pistol up. A span
          To live, it hurries, and to feel it hastes.
     ``To me, Onegin, all this glory
     To me, unsmiling lips bring terror,
     to meet his thirsty lips... What daze,
     to Moscow settled in a trice.
     to mourn for Russia's gloomy savour,
     To my astonishment I've seen her,
     to my young days, it's time I turned
     to Olga's face, he whispered low
     to pass the evening. No? then tot
     to pass the time was Eugene's theme:
     To private tastes we each subscribe:
     To reading from this odd collection
     To talk, to general conversation
     to Tanya, all's an empty show.
     to the Larins' had caused a spout
     To whom do you, from all the train
     to wreak, by stirring Lensky's ire,
     to your loved ones? They do maintain
     ``To...?'' ``Larina.'' ``Tatyana? never!''
     Today a mental fog enwraps us,
     ``Today he promised he'd be here,''
     Today it's turn and turn about.
     Today... the sad memorial's lonely,
     too weak to change, I'm staying vicious,
     torment of pride? And why's he come?
     towards the Larins' and arriving
translated only the first part of the famous verse.'' Pushkin's note.
     Triquet sings, out of tune. Loud clapping

     True, scorn should punish and should bridle

     Vladimir drops, hand softly sliding
     Vladimir Lensky, whose creator
     Vladimir Lensky. Quick, let's dine!
     Vladimir shuts the book, for writing
     Vladimir to this casual mention
     Vladimir's challenge found expression
     Vladimir, wealthy and good-looking,
     ``Wait, I'll present you -- but you banish
     Walking her horse in introspection
     Walking? The country that you roam
     was Göttingen, his alma mater,
     Was it for you that I became
     Was it not in such sweet employment
     Was it to no effect that he,
     Was she the Tanya he'd exhorted
     was the first thing that Olga said.
     We all meandered through our schooling
     We all resemble more or less
     We each enjoy a special hobby,
     We each have enemies in this world,
     We must confess that taste deserts us
     We too shall find our hour is waiting;
     We've many neighbours round about;
     Well, I must make a frank confession,
     ``Well, I won't hold you up or bore you;
     ``Well, what?'' the neighbour says, ``he's killed.''

     Weltered in tears, and sorely smarting,
     were all the law that I would use;
     were chanted, I remember when --
     What ails him? he's in some strange daze!
     What breasts! What soul!... We'll go one day
     What cause has won me your attention?
     What do I want? what am I after,
     What else? Quite drunk with love's illusion,
     What fate is my tomorrow brewing?
     What folly! and what retribution!

what he can do.'' Nabokov.

     What of it? Nothing. I'm just sending

     when our Zaretsky met his eyes.
     When out to burst a rival's bubble,

     when suddenly I saw this treasure

     Whenever nyanya had collected
     Where are you? come -- and my own right
     Where is the fire that once ignited,
     where nowadays I'm soundly trounced,
     where Tanya now confronts Eugene.
     Where to, God knows. The trail is dead.

     Who taught her an address so tender,

     Who'll never fault our vices, or
     Who'll sow no calumnies around us?
     Who's not disgusted by cajoling,
     ``Who? that fat general?'' Tanya cried.
     Whom then to credit? Whom to treasure?
     Whose fond attentions will astound us?
     ``Whose glance, provoking inspiration,

     Why have you gone all pale and queasy?''
     Why is Tatyana guiltier-seeming?

     Why, pretty one, you're up already!

     with cause that I've recalled them here.
     with censure -- I've done all to earn it!

     with eyes aflame Onegin rises
     with Guillot; while pourparlers last
     With mounts from home, or postal station,
     with neighbour Lensky, the deceased.
     with old Anisia. The next day
     with Olga, all have pierced her soul;
     with our Mamas, and a sensation
     With reason, too: for when he'd vetted
     With spelling scrambled to perdition,
     With that, in tears, and quite worn out,
     with The Well-Meaner10 on her knee?
     with Tolstoy's2 brush, or decorated
with which XXXII ends, is Pushkin's own contribution, a sample as it were of
     With womankind, the less we love them,
     with young Semyónova,9 and there
     without a word Tatyana leant
     Without romance, or false insistence,
     Worse luck, Larina crawled; the employment
     would fill Tatyana from afar
     would Hymen bring us -- blooms that might
     wound that had seared my Tanya's heart!

          O Russia!
     Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila,

     Buyánov whirls off Pustyakova;
     Tatyana on; Miss Kharlikova,
     and then old cousin Pelagéya
     but now my brain is darkened, Tanya:
     I'm old, my mind is blunted, Tanya;
     ``I reckon, by God's will. My Vanya
     My mind is fuddled.'' ``Tell me, nyanya,
     ``How slow you are at guessing, nyanya!''
     ``How did you come to marry, nyanya?''
     it was goodbye, Monsieur l'Abbé.
     but I, in love, was dull and dumb.
     Is spleen his trouble, or the dumb
     Iván Petróvich still is dumb,
     He was without that dithyrambic
     a monster of the gens Satanic,
     Remember the retort satiric!
     How oft she'd lead me, by the Tauric
     Is Others' View,5 that clever lyric,
     Eugene's response was automatic;
     Through the tight ranks -- aristocratic,
     Searching the table exegetic
     But soft! You hear? A scowling critic,
     boo Phaedra out as paralytic,
     Now, Lensky, would it be so bad
     The horses, as they sense the dead,
     The happiness of youth is dead,
     Where to, God knows. The trail is dead.
     Lel6 floats about above her head;
     a single thing to her. His head
     can disavow that. I have read
     in friendly gatherings where I read,
     but Olga would have never read!
     and for belle Nina, as it read,
     for Tanya, winter's ways are dread.
     But that's enough. At once, in stead,
     he's put belle Tatiana instead.
     His wife, just like Tatyana, had

     Tanya's undressed, and lies in bed.
     At last he wakes, and stirs in bed,
     Tatyana simply lay in bed,
     on a small bench by Tanya's bed,

     Eugene, at Olga's side, was racked
     profoundly sunk, Tatyana stalked
     Wildly the fearful laughter pealed;
     but no, my Moscow never stumbled
     Meanwhile with pain her soul was girdled,
     A sudden clatter!... blood was curdled...
     The lady of the house has fled.
     For what charade is he apparelled?

     Evgeny looks at Lensky, chilled
     ``Well, what?'' the neighbour says, ``he's killed.''
     down from his Kalmuck steed he rolled
     Yet once for him her thoughts had whirled,
     His hair was fashionably curled,
     but just then Eugene's pistol flamed...
     and Lensky, left eye closing, aimed --
     The jealous poet's gloom is lightened!
     he's host, that's obvious. Thus enlightened
     Tanya's no longer quite so frightened
     But I myself read my bedizened

     For several days she peaked and pined
     Who in that flash could not have reckoned

     I had most surely never reckoned
     to my young days, it's time I turned
     Tatyana went with them, and sped

     on Eugene, he was deeply stirred:
     deep in Moldavia the abhorred,
     with neighbour Lensky, the deceased.
     Like convicts in a dream released
     for long... for evermore. We've chased
     Unforced, as conversation passed,
     Still on the board, the beakers hissed,
     a haze in me, but I grew used

     Thronged by adorers, I've detected
     I know, Godsent one, I'm protected
     By now whist's heroes have completed
     No path to see: the snow has drifted
     And suddenly her radiance lighted
     He was too young to have been blighted
     Suddenly, from a crest, she sighted
     Where is the fire that once ignited,
     Winter!... The countryman, enchanted,
     Yet -- fear itself she found presented
     Sometimes a landscape's represented,
     a tomb, a Cyprian shrine's invented,
     Lensky of course was quite untainted
     Between the lines of text as printed,
     Since earliest boyhood he had doted
     A thought was born, and quickly noted...
     To harmless idleness devoted,
     But it was passion that preempted
     From that rough spell at last exempted,
     ``Poor Yorick,'' said he, broken-hearted:
     Outside the gate Tatyana parted
     Reader, I wish that, as we parted --
     Between them, every topic started
     Eugene would willingly have started
     So there she stood, forlorn, deserted!
     Now for the first time she's escorted
     Was she the Tanya he'd exhorted
     jealously, shyly, I've imported
     She was like him and always sported
     And long, as if through mists that spurted,
     Eugene turned countryman. He tasted
     With reason, too: for when he'd vetted
     the strophe over which I slaved;
     Russian pancakes were always served;
     by sluggish Lethe may be swallowed,
     a stride on Petrarch's path, allayed
     or Freischütz as it might be played
     and, hands a-tremble, Nyanya prayed
     Lensky has watched: his rage has blazed,
     nor his,2 who sings of Finland's maid.
     was the first thing that Olga said.
     Her eyes were opened, and she said
     then, stepping nearer, Eugene said:
     So my Zaretsky, as I said,
     this Grandison of hers was splendid,
     two verses of the Aeneid.
     Still tumbling, devil, snake and Cupid
     Still in the porch, exhausted-stupid,

     He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.

     and now at last he saw the World.
     We each have enemies in this world,

     the letter from Tatyana's hand:

     it brought back Tanya from her trance.
     It fascinates by its assurance
     Spoilt by the habit of indulgence,

     Without romance, or false insistence,

     I grasp a stirrup with affection,
     I gave no rein to sweet affection:
     I feel a brotherly affection,
     Whatever in this rough confection
     on Eugene's lips. In his dejection,
     I've drawn a plan and a projection,
     Lending his tone a grave inflection,
     He lacked the slightest predilection

     The flirt has reason's cool volition;
     His unexpected apparition,
     Protect me from such apparition
     what is he? Just an apparition,
     I'm blind to every apparition;

     at first Madame gave him tuition,
     Vladimir to this casual mention

     What breasts! What soul!... We'll go one day
     Then, plunged in the housekeeper's day,

     and read my Apuleius keenly,
     It all seemed new -- for two days only --
     Onegin's life, you see, was holy;
     Onegin still is slumbering deeply.
     By now the sun is climbing steeply,
     So Lensky wrote, obscurely, limply

     Such were a young rake's meditations --
     by will of Zeus, the high and just,
     Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila,
     Onegin, my good friend, was littered
     and bred upon the Neva's brink,
     where you were born as well, I think,
     There once I too strolled back and forth:
     but I'm allergic to the North...1

     He gave three balls a year, and rather
     Fate saved Evgeny from perdition:
     at first Madame gave him tuition,
     from her Monsieur took on the child.
     He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
     Monsieur l'Abbé, the mediocre,
     No moralizing from this joker;
     and then a stroll in Letny Park.
        IV
     But when the hour of youthful passion
     struck for Evgeny, with its play
     it was goodbye, Monsieur l'Abbé.
     Eugene was free, and as a dresser
     made London's dandy his professor.
     His hair was fashionably curled,
     and now at last he saw the World.
     In French Onegin had perfected
     The World found this enough to treat
     Eugene as clever, and quite sweet.

     We all meandered through our schooling
     haphazard; so, to God be thanks,
     Onegin was assessed by many
     Unforced, as conversation passed,
        VI
     Now Latin's gone quite out of favour;
     Onegin knew enough to savour
     make Juvenal his text, or better
     two verses of the Aeneid.
     He lacked the slightest predilection
     that stretched from Romulus in his prime
        VII
     He was without that dithyrambic
     He cursed Theocritus and Homer,
     in Adam Smith was his diploma;
     His father failed to understand
        VIII
     Evgeny's total store of knowledge
     I have no leisure to recall;
     which Ovid sang, for which the bard,
     deep in Moldavia the abhorred,
     far, far from Italy, his adored.

     Some days he's still in bed, and drowses,
     What? Invitations? Yes, three houses
     Which one comes first? It's just the same
     Meanwhile, attired for morning strolling
     Eugene attends the boulevard,
     until Bréguet's unsleeping chime
        XVI
     He mounts the sledge, with daylight fading:
     ``Make way, make way,'' goes up the shout;
     He's flown to Talon's,4 calculating
     that there his friend Kavérin's5 waiting;
     wine of the Comet6 fills the cup;
     youth's choice, the flower of French cuisine:
     and pâté, Strasbourg's deathless glory,
     sits with Limburg's vivacious cheese
        XVII
     More wine, he calls, to drench the flaming
     when Bréguet's chime is heard proclaiming
     He's off -- this ruthless legislator
     at Cleopatra, hiss her off,
     boo Phaedra out as paralytic,
     encore Moëna,7 -- and rejoice

     Enchanted land! There like a lampion
     Fonvizin8 sparkled, freedom's champion,
     and the derivative Knyazhnín:8

     our friend Katénin8 brought to bear

     The house is packed out; scintillating,
     Then with a half-ethereal splendour,
     Istómina,11 thronged all around
     by Naiads, one foot on the ground,
     like fluff before Aeolian breezes;

     Applause. Onegin enters -- passes
     across the stage; he yawns: ``Ballet --
     he turns away: ``I've had enough --
     now even Didelot's tedious stuff.''

     at the Academic Diction-book.

     That isn't our immediate worry:
     Onegin has outrun us all.
     Along the fronts of darkened houses,
        XXVIII
     Up to the porch our hero's driven:
     and entered. Ballroom overflowing...
     spurs of Chevalier Gardes are clinking,
        XXIX
     In days of carefree aspirations,
     You husbands, deeply I respect you!
     I'm at your service to protect you;

     Alas, on pleasure's wild variety
     I've wasted too much life away!
     But, did they not corrupt society,
     I'd still like dances to this day:
     I love their feet -- though I confess
     that all of Russia can't contribute
     one pair! I pay them memory's tribute
     though cold I am and sad; in sleep

     On the seashore, with storm impending,
     how envious was I of the waves
     I longed, like every breaker hissing,
     No, never in the hottest fire
     of boiling youth did I desire
     to kiss Armida's lips, or seek
        XXXIV
     Another page of recollection:
     I grasp a stirrup with affection,
     I feel a small foot in my hand;
     But, now I've praised the queens of fashion,
        XXXV
     And Eugene? half-awake, half-drowsing,
     while Petersburg's already rousing,
     The city's early sounds awake her;
     and more than once the German baker,
        XXXVI
     Exhausted by the ballroom's clamour,
     Then, after midday he'll be waking;

     It's true, I'll not misrepresent them,
     some ladies preach from Say and Bentham,
     And what's more, they're so supercilious,
        XLIII
     You too, prime beauties in your flower

     Escaped from social rhyme and reason,
     I was Onegin's friend that season.
     I liked his quality, the dream
     The bitterness was mine -- the ice
     of blind Fortuna and of men
        XLVI
     He who has lived and thought is certain
     he's gnawed by serpent Recollection,
     and by Repentance. All this lends,
     At first Onegin's tongue produced
     a haze in me, but I grew used

     of Dian's visage, in our fancies
     Like convicts in a dream released

     Evgeny stood, with soul regretful,
     just as the Poet15 paints himself.
     Silence was everywhere enthralling;
     from Million Street16 came floating round;
     Yet sweeter far, at such a time,
     the strain of Tasso's octave-rhyme!

     O Adrian waves, my invocation;
     O Brenta, I'll see you in dream;

     I'll float in gondola's seclusion;
     the tongue of love and of Petrarch.

     When comes my moment to unteher?
     I walk the shore,17 I watch the weather,
     I signal to each passing sail.
     Beneath storm's vestment, on the seaway,
     when shall I start on my escape?
     It's time to drop astern the shape
     my Africa,18 where waves break high,
     to mourn for Russia's gloomy savour,
     land where I learned to love and weep,
        LI
     Eugene would willingly have started
     His father died; and (as expected)
     before Onegin there collected
     To private tastes we each subscribe:
     Evgeny, hating litigation,
     old Uncle's end was soon to be.
        LII
     In fact one day a note came flying
     Uncle, in bed, and near to dying,
     Evgeny read the sad epistle
     but, when he'd rushed to Uncle's manor,
        LIII
     The yard was bursting with dependants;
     they buried Uncle, congregated
     Eugene turned countryman. He tasted
        LIV
     It all seemed new -- for two days only --
     Yes, spleen was waiting like a sentry,
        LV
     No, I was born for peace abounding
     To harmless idleness devoted,
     I roam by the secluded lake.
     And every morning I awake
     Was it not in such sweet employment
     that once I spent my happiest days?
        LVI
     O flowers, and love, and rustic leisure,
     o fields -- to you I'm vowed at heart.
     I regularly take much pleasure
     myself and Eugene, lest a reader
     that, like proud Byron, I can draw
     the poet's only theme is ``I.''
        LVII
     Poets, I'll say in this connection,
     In time past, objects of affection
     then from the Muse there came revival:
     and captive girls, by Salgir20 lying.
     And now, my friends, I hear from you
     To whom do you, from all the train

     ``Whose glance, provoking inspiration,
     No one's, I swear by God! in sadness
     I suffered once from all the madness
     of love's anxiety. Blessed is he
     a stride on Petrarch's path, allayed
     but I, in love, was dull and dumb.
        LIX
     Love passed, the Muse appeared, the weather
     now free, I once more weave together
     I write, my heart has ceased its pining,
     I'm grieving still, but no more tears,
     That's when I'll sit down to compose
        LX
     I've drawn a plan and a projection,
     Meanwhile my novel's opening section
     is finished, and I've looked it through
     but I refuse to chop or change.
     The censor's tribute, I'll arrange:
     I'll feed the journalists for dinner
     So now be off to Neva's brink,

Chapter Two
          O rus!
           Horace
          O Russia!
        I
     The place where Eugene loathed his leisure
     The manor house, in deep seclusion,
     the pensive Dryads' hiding-ground.
        II
     The château was of a construction
     High ceilings everywhere abounded;
     All this has now gone out of fashion,
     I don't know why, but for my friend
        III
     The rustic sage, in that apartment,
     Oak-floored, and simple as a stable:
     And of the cupboards, one contains
     fruit liqueurs and an Almanack
        IV
     Alone amid all his possessions,
     to pass the time was Eugene's theme:
     A thinker in a desert mission,
     But, in a fearful huff, his thrifty
        V
     At first they called; but on perceiving
     on a fast stallion from the Don,
     ``The man's a boor; his brain is missing,
     The vote was passed without demur.
        VI
     Meanwhile another new landowner
     Vladimir Lensky, whose creator
     was Göttingen, his alma mater,
     a poet, and a Kantian sage.
     He'd brought back all the fruits of learning
     from German realms of mist and steam,
        VII
     He was too young to have been blighted
     In heart's affairs, a sweet beginner,
     He sweetened up with fancy's icing
        VIII
     He was convinced, a kindred creature
        IX
     Compassion, yes, and indignation,
     He roamed the world, his lyre behind him;
     Schiller and Goethe had refined him,
     the Muses' lofty arts and fashions,
        X
     He sang of love, to love subjected,
     He sang of grief and parting-time,
        XI
     But in that desert his attainments
     only to Eugene showed their worth;
     Lensky disliked the entertainments
     Their talk, so sound on every matter,
        XII
     Vladimir, wealthy and good-looking,
     between their girls and this half-Russian.
     As soon as he appears, discussion
     and Dunya works the samovar;
     and whisper ``Dunya, pay attention!''
     then, help me God, she caterwauls:
     ``Come to me in my golden halls.''
        XIII
     Lensky of course was quite untainted
     with Eugene proved a tempting prize.
     So, verse and prose, they came together.
     No ice and flame, no stormy weather
     At first, disparity of heart
     Friendship, as I must own to you,
        XIV
     But friendship, as between our heroes,
     Napoleon's our sole inspiration;
     More tolerant in his conception
     than most. Evgeny, though he knew
        XV
     He smiled as Lensky talked: the heady
     to Eugene all was new and thrilling;
        XVI
     Between them, every topic started
     In the white heat of some dissension
     fragments of poems from the North,
     the tolerant Evgeny heard --
        XVII
     But it was passion that preempted
     From that rough spell at last exempted,
     Onegin spoke about its flights
     Happy is he who's known its fretful
        XVIII
     When we've retreated to the banner
     So a disabled soldier-man,
        XIX
     But it's the talent for concealing
     As, lovingly, in his confession,
     Eugene, with solemn face, paid heed,
     Lensky ingenuously related
     Onegin swiftly came to know
        XX
     Ah, he had loved a love that never
     devoted to the Muse, or learning,
        XXI
     Since earliest boyhood he had doted
     on Olga; from heart's ache still spared,
     Away inside that unassuming
        XXII
     And our young poet -- Olga fired him
     Farewell the games of golden childhood!
        XXIII
     Full of obedience and demureness,
     in Olga everything expresses --
     once I too liked it very much;
     Reader, the elder sister now
        XXIV
     Tatyana3 was her name... I own it,
     What of it? it's euphonious, pleasant,
     I know it, in the thoughts of all
     We must confess that taste deserts us
        XXV
     So she was called Tatyana. Truly
     Shy as a savage, silent, tearful,
     Tatyana had a changeling look
     in her own home. She never took
        XXVI
     Reflection was her friend and pleasure
     Her tender touch had never fingered
     Sign of the urge for domination:
        XXVII
     Tatyana had no dolls to dandle,
     Tatyana never knew the attraction
     Whenever nyanya had collected
     for Olga, on the spreading lawn,
     her little friends, Tatyana'd yawn,
        XXVIII
     She loved the balcony, the session
     In winter, when for longer time
     Tatyana'd rise by candlelight.
        XXIX
     From early on she loved romances,
     of Richardson and of Rousseau.
     Her father, kindly, well-regarded,
     His wife, just like Tatyana, had
     on Richardson gone raving mad.
        XXX
     And not because she'd read him, either,
     Lovelace, or Grandison, or neither;
     so often from her Moscow cousin
     Princess Alina. She was still
     this Grandison of hers was splendid,
     and junior Ensign in the Guards.
        XXXI
     She was like him and always sported
     The better to dispel her sorrow
     at first, with God knows whom to see,
     Then, plunged in the housekeeper's day,
     In stead of happiness, say I,
        XXXII
     For it was custom that consoled her
     Mushrooms in brine, for winter eating,
     accounts, shaved forelocks,4 Sunday bath;
        XXXIII
     No, soon she changed her old demeanour:
     Praskovya re-baptized ``Polina'';
     the Russian N, like N in French;
     album and stays, Princess Alina,
     ``Akulka'' the onetime Selina,
        XXXIV
     Her loving spouse with approbation
     His life went sailing in calm weather;
     The evening passes, and meanwhile
     here's tea that Olga's been preparing;
        XXXV
     Throughout their life, so calm, so peaceful,
     for them, in Butterweek5 the greaseful,
     Russian pancakes were always served;
        XXXVI
     And so they lived, two ageing mortals,
     Just before dinner, from his labours
     He was a good and simple barin;6
     ``A humble sinner, Dimitry Larin,
     servant of God, and Brigadier.''
        XXXVII
     Lensky, restored to his manorial
     ``Poor Yorick,'' said he, broken-hearted:
     How many times I made a toy
     of his Ochákov7 decoration!
     He destined Olga's hand for me,
     kept asking: "shall I live to see"...''
     Lensky composed in autograph
        XXXVIII
     There too, he honoured, hotly weeping,
     Alas! the generations must,
     We too shall find our hour is waiting;
        XXXIX
     So glut yourselves until you're sated
     its nullity I've always hated,
     I know too surely how it ends.
     I'm blind to every apparition;
     I never lived or wrote for praise;
     yet how I wish that I might raise
        XL
     And someone's heart will feel a quiver,
     from drowning's death in Lethe river
     the strophe over which I slaved;
     I thank him without reservation,
     the peaceful Muses' devotee,

     ``Gladly.'' ``So when?'' ``Why not tonight?
     They will receive us with delight.''
        III
     ``Let's go.'' The friends, all haste and vigour,
     The protocol is all one wishes:
        IV
     And home was now their destination;
     ``You yawn, Onegin?'' ``As I'm used to.''
     ``This time I think you've been reduced to
     new depths of boredom.'' ``No, the same.

     Olga's no life in her regard:
     any Madonna by Van Dyck:
     Lensky had a curt word to say
        VI
     Meanwhile the news of Eugene coming
     to the Larins' had caused a spout
     Conjecture found unending matter:
     claiming Tatyana'd found her man;
     Of Lensky's fate they said no more --
        VII
     Tatyana listened with vexation
     Her feelings in their weary session
        VIII
     Tatyana now need wait no longer.
     Her eyes were opened, and she said
     ``this is the one!'' Ah, ever stronger,
     She hates a friendly voice's sound,
     Sunk in dejection, she won't hear
        IX
     Now, she devours, with what attention,
     These figures from the world of seeming,
     the lover of Julie Wolmar,3
     and Malek Adel,4 de Linar,5
     and Werther, martyred and doom-laden,
     and Grandison beyond compare,

     perhaps, though Phoebus warns, I'll see
     No secret crimes, and no perditions,
     no, quite naively I'll retell
     a Russian family's old traditions;

     I'll catalogue each simple saying
     I'll part them, bring them back together;
     I'll make them spar another round,

     Tatyana dear, with you I'm weeping:
     Dear Tanya, you're condemned to perish;

     Tatyana, hunted by love's anguish,
     Tatyana, sleepless in the dark,

     ``I can't sleep, nyanya: it's so stifling!
     ``Why, Tanya, what...?'' ``All's dull and trifling.
     The olden days, I want to hear...''
     ``What of them, Tanya? I was able,
     I kept in mind an ancient store
     but now my brain is darkened, Tanya:
     now I've forgotten all I knew.

     My mind is fuddled.'' ``Tell me, nyanya,

     I'm near to sobbing, near to weeping!...''
     ``You're ill, God have you in his keeping,
     the Lord have mercy on us all!
     I'll sprinkle you with holy water,
     ``Nurse, I'm not ill; I... I'm in love.''

     ``I am in love,'' Tatyana's wailing
     ``My dearest heart, you're sick and ailing.''
     ``I am in love; leave me alone.''
     And all the while the moon was shining
     on a small bench by Tanya's bed,
        XXI
     Tatyana watched the moon, and floated
     A thought was born, and quickly noted...
     ``Go, nurse, and leave me here apart.
     Give me a pen and give me paper,
     good night; I swear I'll lie down soon.''
     She was alone, lit by the moon.
     Elbow on table, spirit seething,
     still filled with Eugene, Tanya wrote,
     She folds the page, lays down the plume.,
     Tatyana! it's addressed... to whom?
        XXII
     I've known too many a haughty beauty,
     I've run a mile, I must avow,
     ``Abandon hope for evermore.''9
     Our love is what they most abhor;
     Ladies of such a cast, I think,
     you too have seen on Neva's brink.
        XXIII
     Thronged by adorers, I've detected
     To my astonishment I've seen her,
     I've seen how, trustful in his blindness,
        XXIV
     Why is Tatyana guiltier-seeming?
     Such feckless passion -- as I live,
        XXV
     The flirt has reason's cool volition;
     Tatyana's love is no by-play,
     like a sweet child. She'll never say:
     ``By virtue of procrastinating
        XXVI
     I see another problem looming:
     I must translate -- there's no presuming --
     the letter from Tatyana's hand:
     her Russian was as thin as vapour,
     she never read a Russian paper,
     she wrote in French... what a confession!
     in Russian never found expression,
     till now our language -- proud, God knows --

     They should be forced to read in Russian,

     with The Well-Meaner10 on her knee?
     I ask you, each and every poet!
     is it not true that Russian speech,

     Protect me from such apparition
     as bonneted Academician
     To me, unsmiling lips bring terror,
     of grammar, Russian language too.
     Now, to my cost it may be true
        XXIX
     No, incorrect and careless chatter,
     too weak to change, I'm staying vicious,
     I still find Gallicism delicious
     of Bogdanóvich's11 refrains.
     But that's enough. My beauty's letter
     I gave my word, alas, though now
     I own it: tender Parny's12 rhyme

     Tatyana's letter, treasured ever
     I read with secret pain, and never
     Who taught her an address so tender,
     Who taught her all this mad, slapdash,
     It baffles me. But I'll repeat
     or Freischütz as it might be played
        Tatyana's Letter to Onegin
     ``I write to you -- no more confession
     I know it's now in your discretion
     ``But, if you've kept some faint impression
     At first I thought it out of season
     if I'd possessed the slightest reason
     I might have seen you, heard you speak

     But you're not sociable, they say:
     ``Why did you visit us, but why?
     Lost in our backwoods habitation
     I'd not have known you, therefore I

     I've no one here who comprehends me,
     dumb I must perish, and alone.

     Now Tanya's groaning, now she's sighing;
     But now the radiance of the moon
     is dimmed. Down there the valley soon
     Down there, by slow degrees, the stream
     to Tanya, all's an empty show.
        XXXIII
     She's paid the sunrise no attention,
     Softly the door is opened, enter
     grey Filatevna, to present her
     ``Get up, my child, it's time, get up!
     Why, pretty one, you're up already!
     My early bird! you know, last night
     but now, thank God, you're well and steady,
        XXXIV
     ``Oh nurse, a favour, a petition...''
     ``Command me, darling, as you choose.''
     ``Now don't suppose... let no suspicion...
     but, nurse, you see... Oh, don't refuse...''
     ``My sweet, God warrants me your debtor.''
     ``Then send your grandson with this letter
     quickly to O... I mean to that...
     ``Which neighbour, dear? My head became
     We've many neighbours round about;
        XXXV
     ``How slow you are at guessing, nyanya!''
     ``My sweet, my dearest heart, I'm old,
     I'm old, my mind is blunted, Tanya;
     times were when I was sharp and bold:
     ``Oh nyanya, nyanya, I don't question...
     Now here's a letter, as you see,
     addressed to Onegin''... ...'Well, that's easy.
     But don't be cross, my darling friend,
     you know I'm hard to comprehend...
     Why have you gone all pale and queasy?''
     ``It's nothing, nurse, nothing, I say...
        XXXVI
     Hours pass; no answer; waiting, waiting.
     No word: another day goes by.
     She's dressed since dawn, dead pale; debating,
     Olga's adorer comes a-wooing.
     ``Tell me, what's your companion doing?''
     Tatyana flushed, and started shaking.
     ``Today he promised he'd be here,''
     so Lensky answered the old dear:
     Tatyana lowered her regard
        XXXVII
     Day faded; on the table, glowing,
     and warmed the Chinese teapot; flowing
     Already Olga's hand was gripping
     Tatyana breathed on the cold pane,
     ``OE'' devotedly inlaced.
        XXXVIII
     Meanwhile with pain her soul was girdled,
     A sudden clatter!... blood was curdled...
     Now nearer... hooves... and in the yard
     Evgeny! ``Ah!'' Tatyana, fleeting
        XXXIX
     She dropped... ``It's he! Eugene arriving!
     Oh God, what did he think!'' A dream
     Maidservants on the beds just now
        The Song of the Girls
     ``Maidens, pretty maidens all,
     Strike the ditty up, my sweets,
     When we draw a fellow in,
     Never come and overhear
        XL
     They sing; unmoved by their sweet-sounding
     choruses, Tanya can but wait,
     So the poor butterfly will quiver
        XLI
     But finally she heaved a yearning
     she found Evgeny, eyes a-glitter,
     seared as by fire, she stopped. Today
     I lack the strength required to say
     my friends, I need to pause a spell,
     and walk, and breathe, before I tell
     I need to rest from all this rhyme:
     I'll end my tale some other time.

Chapter Four
          La morale est dans la nature des choses.
           Necker
        (I, II, III, IV, V, VI,1) VII
     With womankind, the less we love them,
     There was a period when cold-blooded
     now Lovelace's renown has faded
        VIII
     How dull are acting and evasion,
     Who's not disgusted by cajoling,
        IX
     Evgeny thought in just this fashion.
     From his first youth he'd known the force,
     Spoilt by the habit of indulgence,
        X
     Though belles had lost his adoration,
     He followed them without illusion,
        XI
     Yet Tanya's note made its impression
     on Eugene, he was deeply stirred:
     Eugene had no wish to betray
     But to the garden, to the scene
     where Tanya now confronts Eugene.
        XII
     Moments of silence, quite unbroken;
     then, stepping nearer, Eugene said:
     ``You wrote to me, and nothing spoken
     can disavow that. I have read
     but I won't praise you -- let me join
     hear my confession as I stand
     I leave the verdict in your hand.
        XIII
     ``Could I be happy circumscribing
     could I accept for just a minute
     then I'd have looked for you alone
     to be the bride I'd call my own.
     Without romance, or false insistence,
     I'll say: with past ideals in view
     I would have chosen none but you
     and been as happy... as I could!
        XIV
     ``But I was simply not intended
     Should your perfections be expended
     Believe (as conscience is my warrant),
     I'd love you, but inside a day,
     What sort of roses, in your notion,
     would Hymen bring us -- blooms that might
        XV
     ``What in the world is more distressing
     For such am I. When you were speaking
        XVI
     ``I've dreams and years past resurrection;
     I feel a brotherly affection,
     Listen to me without resentment:
     You'll love again, but you must teach
     as I have... learn from my belief
        XVII
     So went his sermon. Almost dying,
     Tatyana heard Evgeny out.
     He gave his arm. In sad abstraction,
     without a word Tatyana leant
     as much as in Moscow the proud.
        XVIII
     Agree, the way Eugene proceeded
     By enemies, no less by friends
     We each have enemies in this world,
     but from our friends, good Lord protect us!
     Those friends, those friends! it is, I fear,
     with cause that I've recalled them here.
        XIX
     What of it? Nothing. I'm just sending
     but, inside brackets, I'm contending
        XX
     Hm, hm. Distinguished reader, tell me
     And here my sentiments impel me
     how I interpret this expression:
     that in the usual Christmas scrimmage
     God grant them years and years of health!
        XXI
     Of course, the love of tender beauties,
     Of course. Yet fashion's wild rotation,
     Then verdicts from her husband's quartet
     for Satan, love's a splendid joke.
        XXII
     Whom then to credit? Whom to treasure?
     On whom alone can we depend?
     Who is there who will truly measure
     Who'll sow no calumnies around us?
     Whose fond attentions will astound us?
     Who'll never fault our vices, or
     Don't let a ghost be your bear-leader,
     Just let yourself be your whole care,
     Deserving object: there can be
        XXIII
     Then what resulted from the meeting?
     Alas, it's not so hard to guess!
     Love's frantic torments went on beating
     poor Tanya more intensely burns;
     while dear Tatyana's youth grows dimmer:
        XXIV
     Poor Tanya's bloom begins to languish,
     Neighbours in whispered tones are taking
     But that's enough. At once, in stead,
     I'll gladden your imagination,
     of happy love. For I have been
     I love my Tatyana too much!
        XXV
     From hour to hour a surer capture
     for Olga's beauty, Lensky gives
     He's always with her: either seated
     What else? Quite drunk with love's illusion,
     emboldened by his Olga's smile,
        XXVI
     He reads to Olga on occasion,
     more searching than Chateaubriand;
     As far removed as they were able
     then Lensky moved his pawn, and took,
        XXVII
     Even at home his occupation
     is only Olga: he relieves
     Sometimes a landscape's represented,
     a tomb, a Cyprian shrine's invented,
        XXVIII
     Often of course you'll have inspected
     With spelling scrambled to perdition,
     On the first sheet you'll find a question:
     ``Qu'écrirez-vous sur ces tablettes?''
     and, under, ``toute à vous Annette'';
     ``who loves you more than I, let's see
        XXIX
     There you're entirely sure of finding
     In such an album, friends, I too
     if I show wit in jesting thus.
        XXX
     But you, grand tomes I loathe with passion,
     with Tolstoy's2 brush, or decorated
     by Baratynsky's3 wondrous pen,
     God's thunder burn you up! And when
     the fear and rage with which I foam!
     Deep down, an epigram is stirring
     that I'm just longing to indite --
     but madrigals I've got to write!
        XXXI
     No madrigals were for inscribing
     by Lensky in his Olga's book;
     So you, inspired Yazýkov,4 sobbing
     sing God knows whom, compose with art
        XXXII
     But soft! You hear? A scowling critic,
     All right, you want the resurrection
     Not so? ``No, sirs, the ode's the thing,
        XXXIII
     Only the ode, that solemn story!
     Enough, my friends; it's all so-so.
     Remember the retort satiric!
     Is Others' View,5 that clever lyric,
     ``The elegy's just vain protesting,
     That point I wouldn't mind contesting,
     I'll set two ages by the ears.
        XXXIV
     In love with fame, by freedom smitten,
     what odes Vladimir might have written --
     but Olga would have never read!
     Bards of our tearful generation,
     to your loved ones? They do maintain
     is the supreme reward. Precisely,

     In summertime -- for he was leading

     Bordeaux, you're like a faithful friend,
     long life to our dear friend, Bordeaux!

     The fire was dying; cinders faintly
     The hearth was low beyond all stoking.
     Straight up the chimney, pipes were smoking.
     Still on the board, the beakers hissed,
     (I like a friendly conversation,
     at hours, which, why I cannot think,
     Now hear the friends in dialogue:

     Tanya (profoundly Russian being,
     in Russian winters thrilled at seeing
     The Larins kept the old tradition:
        V
     Tatyana shared with full conviction
     Omens dismayed her with their presage;
     The tomcat, mannered and affected,
     If suddenly aloft she spied
        VI
     In the dark sky, a shooting star
     would fill Tatyana from afar
     And if she happened anywhere
     By dire presentiment awestruck,
        VII
     Yet -- fear itself she found presented
     Christmas came on. What joy, what gladness!
     Yes, youth divines, in giddy madness,
        VIII
     Tatyana looks with pulses racing
     ``The peasants there have wealth abounding,
     in goods and fame!'' But the sad-sounding
     is ``Kit''3 to every maiden's ear.
        IX
     The sky is clear, the earth is frozen;
     Tatyana in low-cut attire
     is sad old moon's... Hark! snow is creaking...
     He looks, and answers: ``Agafon.''4
        X
     Prepared for prophecy and fable,
     then sudden fear attacked Tatyana...
     I too -- when I recall Svetlana5
     I'm terrified -- so let it be...
     Tatyana's rites are not for me.
     She's dropped her sash's silken billow;
     Tanya's undressed, and lies in bed.
     Lel6 floats about above her head;
     Now all was still. Tatyana slept.
        XI
     She dreamt of portents. In her dreaming
        XII
     As if before some mournful parting
     Tatyana groaned above the tide;
     enormous bear; Tatyana yelled,
        XIII
     A backward look is fraught with danger;
     Ahead of them a pinewood slumbers
     No path to see: the snow has drifted
        XIV
     She's in the wood, the bear still trails her.
     There's powdery snow up to her knees;
        XV
     She's fallen in the snow -- alertly
        XVI
     Tatyana looks, her faintness passes:
        XVII
     But ever stranger and more fearful:
     But how she jumped, when in this hovel
     Onegin sits at table too,
        XVIII
     He nods -- they start to fuss and truckle;
     he's host, that's obvious. Thus enlightened
     Tanya's no longer quite so frightened
     with eyes aflame Onegin rises
     all stand. He walks towards the door.
        XIX
     Now she's alarmed; in desperate worry
     Tatyana struggles to run out --
     she can't; Evgeny's pushed the portal,
     Wildly the fearful laughter pealed;
        XX
     ``She's mine!'' Evgeny's voice of thunder
     alone with him; Onegin takes her
     Olga's appeared upon the scene,
     and Lensky follows her... Eugene,
     damns the intruders; Tanya lies
        XXI
     Louder and louder sounds the wrangle:
     Eugene has caught up, quick as quick,
     Lensky's thrown down. The murk is thick
     Tanya comes to in utter fright...
     pinker than glow of Northern morning,
     flits Olga: ``now, tell me straight out,

     Deaf to her sister's intervention,
     Tatyana simply lay in bed,
     The book displayed, not so you'd know it,
     and yet by Vergil or Racine
     by Scott, by Seneca, or Byron,
     even by Ladies' Fashion Post,
     Martin Zadéka was the siren,
     dean of Chaldea's learned team,
        XXIII
     This work of the profoundest learning
     and to Tanya, when he was through,
     swapped it for odd tomes of Malvina,
     and took two Petriads in calf,
     and volume three of Marmontel.
     Since then Martin Zadéka's spell
     bewitches Tanya... he is able
        XXIV
     Tatyana's haunted by her vision,
     Searching the table exegetic

     Martin Zadéka fails to mend;
     For several days she peaked and pined
        XXV
     But now Aurora's crimson fingers
     Since dawn, whole families have been driving
     towards the Larins' and arriving
     The hall is full of noise and hustle,
        XXVI
     Here with his wife, that bulging charmer,
     fat Pústyakov has driven in;
     Gvozdín, exemplary farmer,
     and the Skotínins, grizzled sages,
     here's Petushkóv, the local fop;
     and look, my cousin's come, Buyánov,
     and counsellor (retired) Flyánov,
        XXVII
     Here, in his red peruke and glasses,
     late of Tambov, Monsieur Triquet
     has come with Kharlikov; he passes
     for witty; in his Gallic way
     inside a pocket Triquet nurses,
     addressed to Tanya, certain verses
     He found them in some old collection,
     Triquet, ingenious poet, dares
     and for belle Nina, as it read,
     he's put belle Tatiana instead.
        XXVIII
     And from the nearby Army station
     the Major's here: he's all the rage
     with our Mamas, and a sensation
     sent at the Colonel's own behest.
     A ball: the joy of every guest!
     Young ladies jump for future blisses...
     But dinner's served, so two by two
     round Tanya congregate the misses,
        XXIX
     They buzz -- but then all talk's suspended --
     And now there's gradually beginning
     Then doors are opened, Lensky enters,
     Onegin too. ``Good Lord, at last!''
        XXX
     Just facing Tanya's where they're sitting;
     From violent passions fast pulsating
        XXXI
     The nervous-tragical reaction,
     girls' tears, their swooning, for Eugene
     Now, faced with this enormous revel,
     He saw the sad girl's trembling state,
     to wreak, by stirring Lensky's ire,
     Already, in exultant fashion,
        XXXII
     Tanya's distress had risked detection
     not only by Evgeny's eye;
     Tsimlyansky wine, between the meat
     Zizi, my crystal and my gem,
        XXXIII
     Freed from its dripping cork, the bottle
     his itching verse, Monsieur Triquet
     the party waits. Seized with an illness
     of swooning, Tanya nearly dies;
     Triquet sings, out of tune. Loud clapping
     and cheers salute him. Tanya must
        XXXIV
     Compliment and congratulation;
     Tanya thanks each one with a phrase.
     When Eugene's turn for salutation
     a wondrous tenderness. And whether
     it brought back Tanya from her trance.
        XXXV
     Chairs are pushed outward, loudly rumbling,
     The banquet's given no cause for sneezing,
     Boston and ombre for the old,
        XXXVI
     By now whist's heroes have completed
     and tea's brought in. Instead of chimes
     I like to tell the time by dinner
     of any Bréguet: and in passing
     I'll just remark, my verses talk
     as yours did, Homer, godlike lord,
        < XXXVII7
     At feasts, though, full of pert aggression,
     I put your genius to the test,
     I make magnanimous confession,
     your Zeus, your Cypris, your whole band
     of Eugene, cold as all creation,
     or of Istómina, my sweet,
     but your vile Helen's not my star --
     no, Tanya's more endearing far.

     No one will think that worth gainsaying,
     though Menelaus, in Helen's name,
     the hapless Phrygians all the same,
     and although Troy's greybeards, collected
     around Priam the much-respected,
     that Menelaus was quite right --
     and Paris too. But hear my pleading:
     as battles go, I've not begun;
     there'll be a fight. For that I give
     my word; no welshing, as I live. >

     Here's tea: the girls have just, as bidden,
     Elated by the music's blaring,
     Petushkóv, local Paris, tearing,
     approaches Olga; Lensky's signed
     Tatyana on; Miss Kharlikova,
     is seized by Tambov's poet-sage;
     Buyánov whirls off Pustyakova;

     Right at the outset of my story

     And now, monotonously dashing

     Buyánov, my vivacious cousin,
     leads Olga and Tatyana on
     to Eugene; nineteen to the dozen,
     Eugene takes Olga, and is gone;
     Lensky has watched: his rage has blazed,

     He asks. She can't accept. Why ever?
     No, she's already pledged her word
     to Evgeny. Oh, God, she'd never...
     How could she? why, he'd never heard...
     He finds the shock beyond all bearing:

           Petrarch
        I
     Seeing Vladimir had defected,
     Eugene, at Olga's side, was racked
     Olinka yawned, just like her neighbour,
     and looked for Lensky, while the labour
     It's over. Supper is proceeding.
     Beds are made up; the guests are all
     Each one by now is badly needing
     a place for rest. Eugene alone
        II
     All sleep: from the saloon a roaring
     proclaims where ponderous Pústyakov
     Gvozdín, Buyánov, Petushkóv
     and Flyánov, amply lubricated,
     the floor serves Triquet for his nap,
     In the two sisters' rooms extended,
     Only Tatyana does not sleep,
     radiance of Dian, sits in pain
        III
     His unexpected apparition,
     with Olga, all have pierced her soul;
     a gulf has gaped... Says Tanya: ``I
     through him is sweetness' self. In grumbling
     I find no sense; the truth is this,
        IV
     But onward, onward with my story!
     A new acquaintance claims our quill.
     Five versts or so from Krasnogórie,
     Lensky's estate, there lives and still
     Zarétsky, sometime king of brawls
        V
     The world of fashion, prone to flatter,
     down from his Kalmuck steed he rolled
     and taken by the French -- some prize! --
     like Regulus, that god of honour,
     in order daily, chez Véry,1
        VI
     Time was, he'd been the wittiest ever,
     Sometimes his tricks would earn him trouble,
     But he could draw a joking moral,
        VII
     Or he knew how to reconcile them
     sed alia tempora! The devil
     So my Zaretsky, as I said,
     for planting cabbage, like Horatius,
        VIII
     He was no fool; appreciated
     by my Eugene, not for his heart,
     of sense and judgement. For his part
     his converse gave Onegin pleasure;
     when our Zaretsky met his eyes.
     His visitor from the beginning
     broke greetings off, and gave Eugene
     a note from Lensky; in between
     Zaretsky watched, and stood there grinning.
     Onegin without more ado
        IX
     Pleasant, in spite of its compression,
     Vladimir's challenge found expression
     Eugene's response was automatic;
     Zaretsky rose without discussion;
     Evgeny, whom the repercussion
        X
     With reason, too: for when he'd vetted
     In second place the poet might
     Evgeny loved him from his heart,
        XI
     He could have spoken without harming,
     that youthful heart. ``But now at least
     True, scorn should punish and should bridle
     Public opinion -- here's our idol,
        XII
     Lensky at home awaits the answer,
     The jealous poet's gloom is lightened!
     But now Vladimir's doubts are still:
        XIII
     Still blazing with resentment's fuel,
     Lensky resolved before the duel
     not to see Olga; in a fret
     He thought that Olga'd be confused,
        XIV
     ``Last night, what made you fly so early?''
     was the first thing that Olga said.
     All Lensky's thoughts went hurly-burly,
     Rage died, and jealousy's obsession,
     Already borne down by regret,
        (XV, XVI,2) XVII
     Now brooding thoughts hold his attention
     he murmurs: ``Olga's mine for saving;
     I'll stop that tempter from depraving
     I'll save this blossom on the shoot,
     Friends, all this meant was: I've a date
        XVIII
     If only Lensky'd known the burning
     wound that had seared my Tanya's heart!
     If Tanya'd had the chance of learning
     that Lensky and Eugene, apart,
     But, even by accident, her passion
     Onegin had no word to say;
     Tatyana pined in secret fashion:
        XIX
     Lensky all evening, in distraction,
     of Muses' offspring; sitting down
     to Olga's face, he whispered low
     ``I think I'm happy.'' Time to go,
     the hour was late. And now from aching
     parting with Olga made him think
     She faced him, questioning: ``But you?...''
     ``It's nothing.'' And away he flew.
        XX
     Once home, he brought out and inspected
     and opened Schiller... but the embrace
     Olga is there, he sees her stand
     Vladimir shuts the book, for writing
     flows and reverberates. Reciting,
     like Delvig3 when he's dining drunk.
        XXI
     By chance those verses haven't vanished;
     I keep them, and will quote them here:
     ``Whither, oh whither are ye banished,
     What fate is my tomorrow brewing?
     No matter; fate's decree is just.
     Whether the arrow has my number,
        XXII
     ``The morning star will soon be shining,
     but I perhaps will be declining
     by sluggish Lethe may be swallowed,
     and I be by the world forgot;
     Friend of my heart, be at my side,
        XXIII
     So Lensky wrote, obscurely, limply
     though what's romantic here I simply
     At last, with dawn upon him, stooping
     and wakened Lensky by exclaiming:
     ``Get up: it's gone six! I'll be bound,
     Onegin's waiting on the ground.''
        XXIV
     But he's mistaken: Eugene's lying
     By now the shades of night are flying,
     Vesper is met by crow of cock --
     Onegin still is slumbering deeply.
     By now the sun is climbing steeply,
     but Eugene hasn't moved; for certain
     At last he wakes, and stirs in bed,
        XXV
     He rings at once, and what a scurry!
     his French valet, Guillot, is there
     And while with all despatch he's dressing
     By now the sledge is at the portal --
     Arrived apace, he gives the word
     to bring across Lepage's4 mortal
        XXVI
     While Lensky'd long been meditating
     Zaretsky, engineer-in-waiting,
     Onegin comes, and makes excuses;
     but in Zaretsky he induces
     amazement: ``Where's your second gone?''
     In duels a pedantic don,
        XXVII
     Evgeny echoed him: ``My second?
     He's here -- Monsieur Guillot, my friend.
     I had most surely never reckoned
     Zaretsky bit his lip. Eugene
     asked Lensky: ``Should we start, I mean?''
     Vladimir to this casual mention
     replies: ``We might as well.'' They walk
     behind the mill. In solemn talk,
     Zaretsky draws up a convention
     with Guillot; while pourparlers last
        XXVIII
     Foes! Is it long since from each other
     But now, in this vindictive pleasure
     and part in kindness? Just the same,
        XXIX
     Pistols are out, they gleam, the hammer
     Now powder's greyish stream is slipping
     into the pan. Securely gripping,
     Guillot, behind a stump in view,
     And now the two opponents doff
     their cloaks; Zaretsky's measured off
        XXX
     ``Now march.'' And calmly, not yet seeking
     four fateful stairs. Then, without slowing
     Evgeny quietly began
     to lift his pistol up. A span
     and Lensky, left eye closing, aimed --
     but just then Eugene's pistol flamed...
     The clock of doom had struck as fated;
        XXXI
     Vladimir drops, hand softly sliding
     to heart. And in his misted gaze
     is death, not pain. So gently gliding
     Onegin, drenched with sudden chill,
     calls out his name... All unavailing:
     The storm is over,5 dawn is paling,
        XXXII
     He lay quite still, and strange as dreaming
     Shot through below the chest -- and streaming
     A moment earlier, inspiration
     The lady of the house has fled.
     Where to, God knows. The trail is dead.

     With a sharp epigram it's pleasant
     to hear him howl: ``that's me!'' You'll get
        XXXIV
     What if your pistol-shot has smitten
        XXXV
     Giving his pistol-butt a squeezing,
     Evgeny looks at Lensky, chilled
     ``Well, what?'' the neighbour says, ``he's killed.''
     Killed!... At this frightful word a-quiver,
     Onegin turns, and with a shiver
     summons his people. On the sleigh
     with care Zaretsky stows away
     The horses, as they sense the dead,
        XXXVI
     My friends, the bard stirs your compassion:
     Where is the fire that once ignited,
        XXXVII
     Perhaps to improve the world's condition,
     for aeons. Maybe it was fated
     for him a lofty stair. His shade,

     though I'll come back to him, yet clearly
     to face him now I feel too frail...

     I have to drag my feet to it.
     My pen, as once, no longer hurries

     I've learnt the voice of new ambition,
     I've learnt new sadness; but in this
     the earlier griefs are what I miss.

     (as I've so oft in jest related)?
     Can it be true, it won't come twice --
     and I'll be thirty in a trice?

     Well, I must make a frank confession,
     So let me with a kind expression
     Thank you for all the gifts I treasure,
     thank you indeed. Alike in sorrow
     and in flat calm I've found the stuff
     of perfect bliss in you. Enough!
     My soul's like crystal, and tomorrow

     And long, as if through mists that spurted,
     Tanya pursued them with her gaze...
     So there she stood, forlorn, deserted!
     The comrade of so many days,
     Shade-like, in purposeless obsession
     Tatyana's heart is rent in two.
        XIV
     Her passion burns with stronger powder
     of far-away Onegin's name.
     She'll not see him, her obligation

     She hesitates, and doubts beset her:

     She wanders on without direction.
     Often she halts against her will,
     As with old friends, she craves diversion
     But the swift summer-time proceeds --
     Now Nature's tremulous, pale effect
     The north wind blows, the clouds are driving --

     She's here, she spreads abroad; she stipples
     frost gleams. We watch with gleeful thanks

     Horses and coach are spliced in marriage;
     The bearded outrider is sitting

     till Moscow, meekly on its knees,
     gave up the ancient Kremlin-keys:
     but no, my Moscow never stumbled
     No feast, no welcome-gifts -- with fire
     From here, deep-sunk in pensive woe,
        XXXVIII
     Farewell, Petrovsky Castle, glimmer
     of fallen glory. Well! don't wait,
     drive on! And now we see a-shimmer
     along Tverskaya Street already
     Street lamps go flashing by, and stalls,
     Bokharans, orchards, merchants, shacks,
     boulevards, chemists, and Cossacks,
        (XXXIX,2) XL
     This wearisome perambulation
     after Saint Chariton's gone past
     On an old aunt, who's long been burning
     And now the door is opened wide,
     a grizzled Calmuck stands to meet them,
     The two old ladies kiss and cry;
        XLI
     ``Princess, mon ange!'' ``Pachette!'' ``Alina!''
     ``Who would have thought it?'' ``What an age!''
     ``How long can you... ?'' ``Dearest kuzina!''
     ``Sit down! how strange! it's like the stage
     or else a novel.'' ``And my daughter
     Tatyana's here, you know I've brought her...''
     ``Ah, Tanya, come to me, it seems
     I'm wandering in a world of dreams...
     Grandison, cousin, d'you remember?''
     ``What, Grandison? oh, Grandison!
     I do, I do. Well, where's he gone?''
     ``Here, near Saint Simeon; in December,
     on Christmas Eve, he wished me joy:
        XLII
     ``As for the other one... tomorrow
     Tanya to all her kin. My sorrow
     outside the house. But you'll be aching
     Oh, I've no strength... I'm tired, my chest...
     These days I'm finding even gladness,
     I'm good for nothing now, my sweet...
     With that, in tears, and quite worn out,
        XLIII
     The invalid's glad salutation,
     her kindness, move Tatyana; yet
     No sleep, beneath that silken curtain,
     She sits down by the window-sill.
     The darkness thins away; but still
     An unknown yard, she sees from thence,
        XLIV
     The kinsfolk in concerted action
     ask Tanya out to dine, and they
     For cousins from afar, on meeting
     ``How Tanya's grown! I pulled your ear
     just yesterday.'' ``And since your christening
     how long is it?'' ``And since I fed
     And all grandmothers who are listening
     ``My goodness, how the years do fly!''
        XLV
     Their look, though, shows no change upon it --
     adorns Aunt Helen, the princess;
     still powdered is Lukérya Lvovna,
     a liar still, Lyubóv Petrovna,
     Iván Petróvich still is dumb,
     Semyón Petróvich, mean and glum,
     and then old cousin Pelagéya
     still has Monsieur Finemouche for friend,
     same Pom, same husband to the end;
        XLVI
     And in their daughters' close embraces
     Tanya is gripped. No comment's made
     at first by Moscow's youthful graces
        XLVII
     Each others' and their own successes,
     Then in return for all this twaddle,
     Tatyana hears but takes no part;
        XLVIII
     To talk, to general conversation
     Tatyana seeks to attune her ear,
     This world's so vacuous that it's got
        XLIX
     In swarms around Tatyana ranging,
     the modish Record Office clerks
     One melancholy fop, declaring
     Once Vyázemsky,4 who chanced to find her
        L
     But where, mid tragic storms that rend her,
     Melpomene wails long and loud,
     and where Thalia, gently napping,
     and where Terpsichore alone
        LI
     They take her too to the Assembly.
     The crush, the heat, as music blares,
     Here insolent prize-dandies wither
     Hussars on leave are racing hither
        LII
     The night has many stars that glitter,
     Moscow has beauties and to spare:
     And yet that goddess whom I'd never
     Enough, I tell you, that will do --
        LIII
     Noise, laughter, bowing, helter-skelter
     galop, mazurka, waltz... Meanwhile
     Tanya looks on; her own indictment
        LIV
     But while she roams in thought, not caring
     The aunts exchanged a look, they fluttered,
     they nudged Tatyana, and each muttered
     ``Look quickly to the left, d'you hear?''
     ``Look to the left? where? what's the matter?''
     ``There, just in front of all that swarm,
     ``Who? that fat general?'' Tanya cried.
        LV
     But here, with our congratulation
     I'm altering my destination
     I drop my hero... I'll be truthful:
     ``It is a friend I sing, a youthful
     Muse of the epic, bless my work!
     Enough. The load is off my shoulder!
     I've paid my due to classic art:

          Fare thee well, and if for ever,
          Still for ever, fare thee well.
           Byron
     Days when I came to flower serenely
     in Lycée gardens long ago,
     and read my Apuleius keenly,
     but spared no glance for Cicero;
     for the first time the Muse came near.
     And suddenly her radiance lighted
     Russia's old glories and their gleams,
        II
     And with a smile the world caressed us:
     aged Derzhávin1 saw and blessed us
        III
     The arbitrary rules of passion
     were all the law that I would use;
     I introduced my saucy Muse
     Bacchante-like, her flighty prancing;
        IV
     When I defected from their union
     and ran far off... the Muse came too.
     How often, with her sweet communion,
     How often on the steep Caucasian
     ranges, Lenora2-like, she'd ride
     How oft she'd lead me, by the Tauric
     the murmuring Nereids recite,
     they praise the Father of the world.
        V
     But then, oblivious of the city,
     in far Moldavia, fit for pity,
     and, in her hand, a small French book.
        VI
     Now for the first time she's escorted
     jealously, shyly, I've imported
     Through the tight ranks -- aristocratic,
        VII
     She enjoys the stately orchestration
     But who stands there, in this selected
     All who behold him find him strange.
     Faces before him flash and change
     Is spleen his trouble, or the dumb
     torment of pride? And why's he come?
     Who on earth is he? not... our hero?
     No doubt about it, it's Eugene.
     ``How long has he been on the scene?
        VIII
     Still as he was? has he stopped prancing?
     Now he's returned, what role's he dancing?
     For what charade is he apparelled?
     Is he a Melmoth, a Childe Harold,
     At least I'll give him some advice:
     ``You know him, do you?'' ``Yes and no.''
        IX
     However has he earned so vicious,
     Is it that we've become officious
        X
     Blest he who in his youth was truly
        XI
     Alas, our youth was what we made it,
     It's agony to watch the hollow
        XII
     To be a butt for the malicious
     is agony, if I may speak,
     a monster of the gens Satanic,
     or for that Demon4 of my dream.
     Onegin -- now once more my theme --
        XIII
     He was the slave of a tenacious,
     He's gone away and left his village,
     like Chatsky,5 he arrived to fall
        XIV
     There came a murmur, for a fleeting
     No, all in her was calm and plain.
     She struck one as the incarnation --
     Shishkov,6 forgive me: I don't know
     the Russian for le comme il faut.
        XV
     Ladies came over, crossed to meet her,
     You'd never class her as a beauty;
     what London calls, with humble duty
     a vulgar touch. I can't translate.
        XVI
     And yet, although it's past conveying,
     I really dote upon the word:
     But let's return to our essential,
     She sits with Nina8 at a table --
     bright Northern Cleopatra she:
     that marble Nina's proved unable
        XVII
     ``Can it be she?'' Eugene in wonder
     demanded. ``Yes, she looks... And yet...
     And every minute his lorgnette
     forgotten features. ``Can you say,
     just there, is talking to the Spanish
     ambassador?'' In some surprise
     ``Wait, I'll present you -- but you banish
     ``But tell me who she is.'' ``My wife.''
        XVIII
     ``You're married? No idea whatever...
     Since when is this?'' ``Two years or more.''
     ``To...?'' ``Larina.'' ``Tatyana? never!''
     ``She knows you?'' ``Why, we lived next door.''
     So to his wife for presentation
     and friend Evgeny. The princess
        XIX
     I don't mean that she never shivered,
     However closely he inspected,
     of the old Tatyana. Eugene tried
     How long he'd been here, was her query,
     from their own country? Then she shot
     with Eugene frozen where he stood.
        XX
     Was she the Tanya he'd exhorted
        XXI
     Eugene forsakes the packed reception,
     By dreams now sad in their conception,
     He wakes -- and who is this who writes him?
     Prince N. respectfully invites him
     to a soirée. ``My God! to her!...
     I'll go, I'll go!'' -- and in a stir
     What ails him? he's in some strange daze!
        XXII
     Once more he counts the hour-bells tolling,
     some minutes long. The words won't fit
     on Eugene's lips. In his dejection,
     a single thing to her. His head
     and obstinate his look. But she
        XXIII
     Her husband enters, thus concluding
     he and Onegin start alluding
     They laugh. The guests begin arriving.
     Already now the talk was thriving
        XXIV
     High rank, of course, and fashion's glasses,
     Saint Petersburg's fine flower was there --
        XXV
     There, with epigrammatic neatness,
        XXVI
     There was -- --,10 so notorious
     cartoonist-pencils of Saint-Priest;11
        XXVII
     But my Eugene that night directed
     his gaze at Tatyana alone --
     of Neva's proud imperial water,
     We all resemble more or less
     our Mother Eve: we're never falling
        XXVIII
     In Tanya, what a transformation!
     had won her loyalty! What soul
     Yet once for him her thoughts had whirled,
     of Morpheus had induced relief
        XXIX
     Love tyrannises all the ages;
     In passion's sluicing rain they freshen,
     But when a later age has found us,
        XXX
     Alas, Eugene beyond all query
     Each day, despite the appeals of reason,
        XXXI
     But she refuses to perceive him,
     At home she'll equably receive him,
     Meanwhile Onegin starts to languish:
     Onegin wastes, you'd almost find
     he's got consumption. In his anguish
        XXXII
     But go he won't: for him, a letter
     He deemed, in general, letters vain,
     past all endurance. You're referred
     to Eugene's letter, word for word.
        Onegin's Letter to Tatyana
     ``I know it all: my secret ache
     What scorn I see in the expression
     What do I want? what am I after,
     I know to what malicious laughter
     ``I noticed once, at our chance meeting,
     yet dared not trust what I could see.
     I gave no rein to sweet affection:
     And then, to part us in full measure,
     Lensky, that tragic victim, died...
     From all sweet things that gave me pleasure,
     for happiness, I sought, and ranged
     What folly! and what retribution!
     ``No, every minute of my days,
     ``But I'm denied this: all for you
     I drag my footsteps hither, yonder;
     I count each hour the whole day through;
     and yet in vain ennui I squander
     And how they weigh! I know about
     I must wake up with the conviction
     ``I dread your stern regard surmising
     I hear the wrath of your reproach.
     How fearful, in and out of season
     ``But so it is: I'm in no state
     I'm yours, in a predestined fashion,
     and I surrender to my fate.''
        XXXIII
     No answer comes. Another letter
     No answer comes. He goes, for better
     or worse, to a soirée. Unheard
     No look, no word for him: she's chosen
     of Twelfth Night's chillest, iciest air.
     To batten down their indignation
     Onegin looks with eyes of fire:
     No tearstains, nothing. Wrath alone
        XXXIV
     Perhaps some secret apprehension
     Ah, all that my Onegin knew...
     No hope! no hope! He leaves the revel,
     And he remembers, in the quiet
        XXXV
     Once more he turned to books, unchoosing,
     devouring Gibbon and Rousseau,
     Manzoni and Chamfort,12 perusing
     Madame de Staël, Bichat,13 Tissot,14
     Herder, and even at times a Russian --
     he read of course the sceptic Bayle15
     and all the works of Fontanelle16 --
     where nowadays I'm soundly trounced,
     were chanted, I remember when --
        XXXVI
     What happened? Though his eyes were reading,
     Between the lines of text as printed,
     Legends, and mystical traditions,
        XXXVII
     Then gradually upon sensation,
     He sees: in slush, stretched out and keeping
     And foes he sees, long-since forgotten,
        XXXVIII
     He got so used to this immersion,
     or joined us poets. His conversion
     It's true, the magnet-like attraction
     of Russian verse, its force in action, --
     Who could have looked the poet better,
     Idol mio or Benedetta,
        XXXIX
     The days flew past; by now the season
     He's neither died, nor lost his reason,
     nor turned a poet. In the burst
     along the Neva in a sleigh,
        XL
     You've guessed before it all began:
     to his Tatyana, yes, he's racing,
     He goes inside, corpse-like of feature...
     He opens up a door. What's that
     The princess, sitting peaked and wan,
        XLI
     Who in that flash could not have reckoned
     Who in the princess for that second
     our hapless Tanya! An emotion
     threw Eugene at her feet -- she stirred,
     she sees it all. The simple maiden,
        XLII
     Tatyana leaves Onegin kneeling,
     to meet his thirsty lips... What daze,
     A pause of silence and inaction,
     ``Enough, stand up. It's now for me
     Onegin, d'you recall the day
     humbly I heard your lesson out?
     Today it's turn and turn about.
        XLIII
     ``For then, Onegin, I was younger,
     and also prettier, I'll be bound,
     what's more, I loved you; but my hunger,
     that could sustain it? Only grimness;
     for you, I think, the humble dimness
     But now -- oh God! -- the thought of you,
     freezes my blood... Yet all the same,
     I'm grateful now with all my heart.
        XLIV
     ``Then, in the backwoods, far from rumour
     I'd nothing to attract your humour...
     Why then do you pursue me now?
     What cause has won me your attention?
     Could it not be that by convention
     I move in the grand monde? that rank,
     earn us the favour of the Court?
        XLV
     ``I weep... In case there still should linger
     your Tanya's image in your mind,
     if I had power to choose your fashion --
     At least you then showed for my years
     But now! what brings you to my feet?
     What trifling could be more complete?
     What power enslaves you, with your seeming
        XLVI
     ``To me, Onegin, all this glory
     is tinsel on a life I hate;
     what's in them? All this loud parading,
     the glare, the fumes in which I live,
     this very day I'd gladly give,
        XLVII
     ``Bliss was so near, so altogether
     attainable!... But now my lot
     is firmly cast. I don't know whether
     I acted thoughtlessly or not:
     I married. I beseech you, go;
     I know your heart: it has a feeling
     I love you (what's the use to hide
     but I've become another's wife --
     and I'll be true to him, for life.''
        XLVIII
     She went -- and Eugene, all emotion,
     stood thunder-struck. In what wild round
     his heart was plunged! A sudden sound,
     Tatyana's husband, now appearing...
     But from the hero of my tale,
     for long... for evermore. We've chased
     Hurrah! let's start congratulating
     ourselves on our landfall. It's true,
        XLIX
     Reader, I wish that, as we parted --
     Goodbye, for now we make an end.
     Whatever in this rough confection
     God grant that from this little book
     God grant you took at least a grain.
     On this we'll part; goodbye again!
        L
     And my companion, so mysterious,
     and yet so light. All that is real
     in your pursuit I've come to know it:
     sweet talk with friends. How many days
     young Tanya first appeared to me,
     Onegin too -- and there to see,
        LI
     Of those who heard my opening pages
     in friendly gatherings where I read,
     as Sadi17 sang in earlier ages,
     They've missed Eugene's completed etching.
     But she who modelled for the sketching
     of Tanya's image... Ah, how great
     Blest he who's left the hurly-burly
     and, with my Eugene, so have I.
